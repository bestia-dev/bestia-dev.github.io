# Youtube videos

Youtube does not allow to upload a new version of the same video.  
I frequently make updates to the videos and I want to upload them.  
Sadly I have to upload the video as a new video, and manually copy the title, description and subtitles.  
Then I get a completely new URL for the video.  

So I cannot use this links to share it to my friends and followers.  

## Redirect in html tag

I will make a html file on my website and in it a redirect to the youtube video.  
When the URL of the video changes I just modify it in one place.  
The URL of my redirect page stays the same.  

## OpenGraph

OpenGraph meta tags allow facebook, twitter and discord to show a title+description+thumbnail instead of your raw link url.  
Preview it here:
<https://opengraph.dev/>

Use this webapp on this example for the url:
<https://bestia.dev/youtube/win10_wsl2_debian11.html>  
add the thumbnail  
<https://bestia.dev/youtube/win10_wsl2_debian11.png>

The webapp create the tags to be copied inside the HTML. Easy.

Reddit is so 1990.  
You can only make a new Post that is a Link to image/video. This is never what I want or need.  
It is impossible to post a Link to image/video inside a text post/comment/reply.

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
