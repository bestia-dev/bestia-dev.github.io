<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-try-it" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#try-it"></a>Try it</h2>
<p dir="auto">The installation is just a bunch of bash scripts.<br>
The scripts are for the Debian OS. It can be installed on bare metal or inside Win10+WSL2.<br>
First download and run the download_script. It will download the rest of the scripts.<br>
After downloading, you can inspect them to see exactly what they are doing. There are a lot of comments and descriptions inside. A more detailed explanation is in this README.md.<br>
Every script will show step-by-step instructions on what to do next.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir -p ~/rustprojects/crustde_install;

<p dir="auto">That's it !</p>
<p dir="auto">This project has also a youtube video tutorial. Watch it:</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://bestia.dev/youtube/crustde_cnt_img_pod.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://bestia.dev/youtube/crustde_cnt_img_pod.jpg" width="400px" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Now we can test the connection from various locations.</p>
<p dir="auto">1. Try the SSH connection from the Debian host:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ssh -i ~/.ssh/crustde_rustdevuser_ssh_11 rustdevuser@localhost
# or using the ssh config file
ssh -F ~/.ssh/config crustde_vscode_cnt
# Choose `yes` to save fingerprint if asked, just the first time.
# type passphrase
# should work !
# try for example
ls
# ls result: rustprojects
# to exit the container
exit"><pre>ssh -i <span class="pl-k">~</span>/.ssh/crustde_rustdevuser_ssh_1 -p 2201 rustdevuser@localhost
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> or using the ssh config file</span>
ssh -F <span class="pl-k">~</span>/.ssh/config crustde_vscode_cnt
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Choose `yes` to save fingerprint if asked, just the first time.</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> type passphrase</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> should work !</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> try for example</span>
ls
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> ls result: rustprojects</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> to exit the container</span>
<span class="pl-c1">exit</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">2. If you are in Win10+WSL2, then try the SSH connection from the Windows command prompt or Windows Powershell terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# test the ssh connection from Windows cmd prompt
&quot;C:\WINDOWS\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe&quot; -i ~\.ssh\crustde_rustdevuser_ssh_1 -p 2201 rustdevuser@localhost
# Choose `y` to save fingerprint if asked, just the first time.
# type passphrase
# should work !
# try for example
ls
# ls result: rustprojects
# to exit the container
exit"><pre><span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> test the ssh connection from Windows cmd prompt</span>
<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>C:\WINDOWS\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> -i <span class="pl-k">~</span><span class="pl-cce">\.</span>ssh<span class="pl-cce">\r</span>ustdevuser_key -p 2201 rustdevuser@localhost
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Choose `y` to save fingerprint if asked, just the first time.</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> type passphrase</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> should work !</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> try for example</span>
ls
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> ls result: rustprojects</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> to exit the container</span>
<span class="pl-c1">exit</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">3. Open VSCode and install extension <code>Remote - SSH</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">4. Then in VSCode <code>F1</code>, type <code>ssh</code> and choose <code>Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...</code> and choose <code>crustde_vscode_cnt</code>.<br>
Choose <code>Linux</code> if asked, just the first time.<br>
Type your passphrase.<br>
If we are lucky, everything works and you are now inside the container over SSH.</p>
<p dir="auto">5. In the <code>VSCode terminal</code> create a simple Rust project and run it:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd ~/rustprojects
cargo new crustde_hello
cd crustde_hello
cargo run"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> <span class="pl-k">~</span>/rustprojects
cargo new crustde_hello
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> crustde_hello
cargo run</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That should work and greet you with "Hello, world!"</p>
<p dir="auto">6. After reboot, WSL2 can create some network problems for Podman.<br>
No problem for Debian on bare metal. But the script is ok to restart the pod and start the sshd server.
So use it in both cases.<br>
We can simulate the WSL2 reboot in <code>Powershell in Windows</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-powershell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="wsl --shutdown "><pre>wsl <span class="pl-k">--</span>shutdown </pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Before entering any Podman command we need first to clean some temporary files, restart the pod and restart the SSH server.<br>
In the <code>host terminal</code> restart the pod after reboot:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sh ~/rustprojects/crustde_install/crustde_pod_after_reboot.sh
podman ps"><pre>sh <span class="pl-k">~</span>/rustprojects/crustde_install/crustde_pod_after_reboot.sh
podman ps</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If the restart is successful every container will be started a few seconds. It is not enough for containers to be in the status "created". Then just repeat the restart procedure.</p>
<p dir="auto">7. Eventually you will want to remove the entire pod. Linux OCI containers and pods are ephemeral, which means just temporary. But your code and data must persist. Before destroying the pod/containers, push your changes to GitHub because removing the pod will destroy also all the data that is inside.<br>
Be careful !<br>
In the <code>WSL2 terminal</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman pod rm -f crustde_pod "><pre>podman pod rm -f crustde_pod </pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-motivation" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#motivation"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Rust is a fantastic young language that empowers everyone to build reliable and efficient software. It enables simultaneously low-level control without giving up high-level conveniences. But with great power comes great responsibility !</p>
<p dir="auto">Rust programs can do any "potentially harmful" things to your system. That is true for any compiled program, Rust is no exception.</p>
<p dir="auto">But Rust can do anything also in the compile-time using <code>build.rs</code> and <code>procedural macros</code>. Even worse, if you open a code editor (like VSCode) with auto-completion (like Rust-analyzer), it will compile the code in the background without you knowing it. And the <code>build.rs</code> and <code>procedural macros</code> will run and they can do "anything" !</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if you are very careful and avoid <code>build.rs</code> and <code>procedural macros</code>, your Rust project will have a lot of crates in the dependency tree. Any of those can surprise you with some "malware". This is called a "supply chain attack".</p>
<p dir="auto">It is very hard to avoid "supply chain attacks" in Rust as things are today. We are just lucky, that the ecosystem is young and small and the malevolent players are waiting for Rust to become more popular. Then they will strike and strike hard. We need to be skeptical about anything that comes from the internet. We need to isolate/sandbox it so it cannot harm our system.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a big open-source project, you will not read and understand every line of code. It is impossible because of the sheer size of projects and it is impossible to gain a deep understanding of all the underlying principles, rules and exceptions of everything. And everything is moving and changing fast and continuously. It is impossible to follow all the changes.<br>
We need to have layered protection between our computer system and some unknown code. In this project, I propose a containerized development environment that will allow some degree of isolation. And in the same time easy to install, transfer and repeat.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's learn to develop "everything" inside a Linux OCI container and to isolate/sandbox it as much as possible from the underlying system.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have to acknowledge that Linux OCI Containers are not the perfect sandboxing solution. But I believe that it is "good enough" for my "Rust development environment". I expect that container isolation will get better with time (google, amazon, Intel, OpenStack and IBM are working on it).<br>
It is possible to use the same Linux OCI container also inside a virtual machine for better isolation. For example, My main system is Win10. Inside that, I have WSL2, which is a Linux virtual machine. And inside that, I have Linux OCI Containers. But because of compiling performance, I decided to go with a Debian dual boot with Linux OCI containers. My opinionated preferences:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>No files/volumes are shared with the host.</li>
<li>The outbound network is restricted to whitelisted domains by a Squid proxy server.</li>
<li>The inbound network is allowed only to "published/exposed" ports.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Yes, there exists the possibility of abusing a kernel vulnerability, but I believe it is hard and they will get patched.<br>
I didn't choose a true virtualization approach, but it is easy to run the container inside a virtual machine. More layers, more protection.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-trust-in-rust-open-source-2022" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trust-in-rust-open-source-2022"></a>Trust in Rust open-source 2022</h2>
<p dir="auto">First I have to talk about TRUST. This is the whole point of this entire project.<br>
We live in dangerous times for "supply chain attacks" in open-source and it is getting worse. This is a problem we need to address!<br>
In this project, you don't need to TRUST ME! You can run all the bash commands inside bash scripts line-by-line. My emphasis is to thoroughly comment and describe what is my intention for every single command. You can follow and observe exactly what is going on. This is the beauty of open source. But this is realistic only for very simple projects.<br>
To be meticulously precise, you still have to trust the Windows code, Linux, GNU tools, drivers, Podman, Buildah, VSCode, extensions, the microprocessor, memory, disc and many other projects. There is no system without an inherent minimal level of TRUST.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-compile-build-speed-in-various-environments" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#compile-build-speed-in-various-environments"></a>Compile (build) speed in various environments</h2>
<p dir="auto">After using these containers for some time I was curious about compile performance in various environments. And I was right!<br>
I tried <code>cargo auto build</code> on my project <code>database_web_ui_on_server</code> in different environments. I build a few times and find an average.</p>
<p dir="auto">18s in container on WSL2 without shared volume<br>
8s  in container on WSL2 with shared volume<br>
6s  in WSL2</p>
<p dir="auto">11s in the container on Debian (dual boot) without shared volume<br>
7s  in the container on Debian (dual boot) with shared volume<br>
6s  in Debian (dual boot)</p>
<p dir="auto">Then I changed the linker to "mold" on Debian. It is 3x faster!<br>
The "mold" linker is experimental Linux only. That's ok for me.</p>
<p dir="auto">6.84s in container on WSL2 without shared volume<br>
5.05s in container on WSL2 with shared volume<br>
3.66s  in WSL2</p>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>4.43s in the container on Debian (dual boot) without shared volume</strong></em><br>
5.35s in the container on Debian (dual boot) with shared volume<br>
3.61s in Debian (dual boot)</p>
<p dir="auto">That is a big difference! I decided I will develop Rust projects in Debian (dual boot) without shared volume with the mold linker. The container steals a little performance for itself, but it is not a big deal in that combination. Security is not cheap!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-docker-and-oci" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#docker-and-oci"></a>Docker and OCI</h2>
<p dir="auto">We all call it Docker, but <a href="https://www.docker.com/" rel="nofollow">Docker</a> is just a well-known company name with a funny whale logo.
They developed and promoted Linux containers. Then they helped to create an open industry standard around container formats and runtimes. This standard is now called OCI (Open Container Initiative). So the correct name is "Linux OCI containers" and "Linux OCI images". Somebody also calls them just "Linux containers".</p>
<p dir="auto">There are alternatives to using Docker software that I will explore here.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-install-podman-in-debian-11bullseye-on-bare-metal-or-in-win10--wsl2" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#install-podman-in-debian-11bullseye-on-bare-metal-or-in-win10--wsl2"></a>Install Podman in Debian 11(Bullseye) (on bare metal or in Win10 + WSL2)</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://podman.io/" rel="nofollow">Podman</a> is a <strong>daemonless</strong>, open-source, Linux native tool designed to work with Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Containers under the control of Podman can be run by a <strong>non-privileged user</strong>. The CLI commands of the Podman <em><strong>"Container Engine"</strong></em> are practically identical to the Docker CLI. Podman relies on an OCI-compliant <em><strong>"Container Runtime"</strong></em> (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers.</p>
<p dir="auto">I already wrote some information on how to install and use the combination of Win10 + WSL2 + Debian11(Bullseye):</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv/win10_wsl2_debian11">https://github.com/CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv/win10_wsl2_debian11</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Podman is available from the Debian11 package manager.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://podman.io/getting-started/installation" rel="nofollow">https://podman.io/getting-started/installation</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's install it. Open the <code>WSL2 terminal</code> and type:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman
podman version
   Version: 3.0.1"><pre>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman
podman version
   Version: 3.0.1</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In WSL2 we see some errors, that don't exist on bare metal.<br>
Wsl2 has a special kernel and Podman needs a small trick to work.<br>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-using-podman" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#using-podman"></a>Using Podman</h2>
<p dir="auto">Using the Podman CLI is just the same as using Docker CLI.<br>
<a href="https://podman.io/getting-started/" rel="nofollow">https://podman.io/getting-started/</a><br>
Inside the <code>WSL2 terminal</code> type:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman images"><pre>podman images</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">We have no images for now.
The words "image" and "container" are somewhat confusing. Super simplifying: When it runs it is a "container". If it does not run it is an "image". The image is just an "installation file". The containers can be <code>started</code> and <code>stopped</code> or <code>attached</code> and <code>detached</code>, but they are <code>run</code> only one time.<br>
For a test, run a sample container. It is a web server.</p>
<p dir="auto">-d means it is run in a detached mode<br>
-t adds a pseudo-tty to run arbitrary commands in an interactive shell<br>
-p stays for publish port</p>
<p dir="auto">The run command will download/pull the image if needed.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman run -dt --name sample_cnt -p 8001:80/tcp docker.io/library/httpd"><pre>podman run -dt --name sample_cnt -p 8001:80/tcp docker.io/library/httpd</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">List all containers:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman ps -a
# it will list also closed container. To clean all the closed container:

<p dir="auto">That should print the HTML page.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, you can remove the <code>sample_cnt</code> container we used:</p>

<p dir="auto">Buildah is a replacement for the <code>docker build</code> command. It is easier to incorporate into scripts. It is pronounced exactly as Builder but with a Bostonian accent ;-)</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/6/getting-started-buildah" rel="nofollow">https://opensource.com/article/18/6/getting-started-buildah</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Rust official images are on the Docker hub: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/rust" rel="nofollow">https://hub.docker.com/_/rust</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I was surprised by the size of the image. It is big from 500 MB compressed to 1.4 GB uncompressed. But this is the size of rust development tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't like that these images have only the <code>root</code> user. I will start from the Debian-11 image and install all I need as a non-privileged user <code>rustdevuser</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the bash terminal pull the image from the Docker hub:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman pull docker.io/library/debian:bullseye-slim"><pre>podman pull docker.io/library/debian:bullseye-slim</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">I wrote the bash script <code>crustde_cargo_img.sh</code></p>

sh crustde_cargo_img.sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will create the image <code>crustde_cargo_img</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The scripts are just bash scripts and are super easy to read, follow, learn and modify. Much easier than Dockerfile. You can even run the commands one by one in the <code>bash terminal</code> and inspect the container to debug the building process.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are a lot of benefits to making a development environment in a container.<br>
We want that everything is isolated/sandboxed and cannot affect our host system (Debian on bare metal or in WSL2 in Win10).<br>
We also don't want to make any changes to our system because of Rust tools or our project needs.<br>
We can have simultaneously more containers, each with a different version of Rust or a different toolchain with all the necessary configuration and tools. We can easily transfer the container to another system or another developer and use it exactly as it is configured. Effortlessly.<br>
We can save/export the container into an image with the source code and the exact state of all developer tools for a particular app version. Then years later we can still work on it for some security patches without the fear that new tools will break the old source code.<br>
You will see that everybody uses <code>podman run</code>, but this is essentially 4 commands in one: <code>pull</code> the image from a repository, <code>create</code> the container, <code>start</code> or <code>attach</code> to the container and exec the bash in interactive mode. I like to use these commands separately because it makes more sense for learning.<br>
Create the container with a fixed name <code>crustde_cargo_cnt</code>:</p>
<p dir="auto">--name - the container name will be <code>crustde_cargo_cnt</code><br>
-ti - we will use the container interactively in the terminal</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman create -ti --name crustde_cargo_cnt docker.io/bestiadev/crustde_cargo_img:latest"><pre>podman create -ti --name crustde_cargo_cnt docker.io/bestiadev/crustde_cargo_img:latest</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">We can list the existing containers with:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman ps -a"><pre>podman ps -a</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now we can start the container:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman start crustde_cargo_cnt"><pre>podman start crustde_cargo_cnt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Open the bash to interact with the <code>container terminal</code>:<br>
-it - interactive terminal</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman exec -it crustde_cargo_cnt bash"><pre>podman <span class="pl-c1">exec</span> -it crustde_cargo_cnt bash</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">We are now inside the <code>container terminal</code> and we can use <code>cargo</code>, <code>rustup</code> and other rust tools. The files we create will be inside the container. We are <code>rustdevuser</code> inside this container, so we will put our rustprojects in the <code>/home/rustdevuser/rustprojects</code> directory.<br>
This container is started from Podman without <code>root access</code> to the host system !<br>
This is a small, but important difference between Docker and Podman.<br>
First let's find the rustc version:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rustc --version
  rustc 1.69.0 "><pre>rustc --version
  rustc 1.69.0 </pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Let's create and run a small Rust program:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd ~/rustprojects
cargo new crustde_hello
cd crustde_hello
cargo run"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> <span class="pl-k">~</span>/rustprojects
cargo new crustde_hello
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> crustde_hello
cargo run</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That should work fine and greet you with "Hello, world!"<br>
We can exit the container now with the command</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="exit"><pre><span class="pl-c1">exit</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When we exited the container we returned to the <code>host terminal</code> of the Debian host.<br>
The container still exists and is still running. Check with <code>podman ps -a</code>.<br>
To interact with it again, repeat the previous command <code>podman exec -it crustde_cargo_cnt bash</code>.<br>
This container does not work with VSCode and we will not need it anymore. If you use another editor, you can use this image/container as a base for your image/container for your editor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Remove the container with:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman rm crustde_cargo_cnt -f"><pre>podman rm crustde_cargo_cnt -f</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">I would like to restrict the use of the network from/to the container.<br>
When using Podman as a rootless user, the network is set up automatically. Only the <code>localhost</code> can be used. The container itself does not have an IP Address because, without root privileges, network association is not allowed. Port publishing as rootless containers can be done for "high ports" only. All ports below <code>1024</code> are privileged and cannot be used for publishing.<br>
I think that all inbound ports are closed by default and I need to explicitly expose them manually.</p>

<p dir="auto">I would like to limit access to the internet only to whitelisted domains:<br>
crates.io, github.com,...<br>
Some malware could want to "call home" and I will try to disable this.<br>
What I need is a "proxy" or "transparent proxy". I will use the leading open-source proxy <code>Squid</code>, but in a container.<br>
It can restrict both HTTP and HTTPS outbound traffic to a given set of Internet domains while being fully transparent for instances in the private subnet.<br>
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-add-dns-filtering-to-your-nat-instance-with-squid/" rel="nofollow">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-add-dns-filtering-to-your-nat-instance-with-squid/</a><br>
I want to use this proxy for the container <code>crustde_vscode_cnt</code>. Container-to-container networking can be complex.<br>
Podman works with <code>pods</code>, that make networking easy. This is usually the simplest approach for two rootless containers to communicate. Putting them in a <code>pod</code> allows them to communicate directly over <code>localhost</code>.<br>
First, create a modified image for Squid:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd ~/rustprojects/crustde_cnt_img_pod/create_and_push_container_images 
sh crustde_squid_img.sh"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> <span class="pl-k">~</span>/rustprojects/crustde_cnt_img_pod/create_and_push_container_images 
sh crustde_squid_img.sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you need, you can modify the file <code>etc_squid_squid.conf</code> to add more whitelisted domains. Then run <code>sh crustde_squid_img.sh</code> to build the modified image.
You can also add whitelisted domains later when you use the squid container. First modify the file <code>~/rustprojects/crustde_cnt_img_pod/create_and_push_container_images/etc_squid_squid.con</code>. Then copy this file into the squid container:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman cp ~/rustprojects/crustde_cnt_img_pod/create_and_push_container_images/etc_squid_squid.conf crustde_squid_cnt:/etc/squid/squid.conf
# Finally restart the squid container
podman restart crustde_squid_cnt"><pre>podman cp <span class="pl-k">~</span>/rustprojects/crustde_cnt_img_pod/create_and_push_container_images/etc_squid_squid.conf crustde_squid_cnt:/etc/squid/squid.conf
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Finally restart the squid container</span>
podman restart crustde_squid_cnt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Watch the squid log if the access has been denied to some domains:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="podman exec crustde_squid_cnt cat /var/log/squid/access.log

<p dir="auto">Check later, if these env variables are set inside <code>crustde_vscode_cnt</code> bash terminal.
These variables should be set when creating the pod.</p>

<p dir="auto">Podman and Kubernetes have the concept of pods, where more containers are tightly coupled. Here we will have the <code>crustde_vscode_cnt</code> that will use <code>crustde_squid_cnt</code> as a proxy. From the outside, the pod is like one entity with one address. All the network communication goes through the pod. Inside the pod, everything is in the <code>localhost</code> address. That makes it easy to configure.<br>
Inside the container <code>crustde_vscode_cnt</code> I want that everything goes through the proxy. These env variables should do that: <code>http_proxy</code>, <code>https_proxy</code>,<code>all_proxy</code>.<br>

<p dir="auto">Open <code>github.com</code> in the browser and sign in, click <code>New</code> and create a new repository named <code>crustde_hello</code>.<br>
GitHub is user-friendly and shows the standard commands we need to run. Choose SSH commands and not HTTPS or CLI. You will find commands similar to the commands below.<br>
In VSCode click on the <code>Source control</code> and click <code>Initialize</code>, then type the commit-msg "init" and click <code>Commit</code>.<br>
Then in <code>VSCode terminal</code> run:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git remote add origin git@github.com:bestia-dev/crustde_hello.git

Always push the changes to GitHub. So you can destroy this pod/container and create a new empty one, then pull the code from GitHub and continue developing. Containers are the worst place to have persistent data stored. They can be deleted at any second for any reason.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a id="user-content-existing-rust-projects-on-github" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#existing-rust-projects-on-github"></a>Existing Rust projects on GitHub</h2>
<p dir="auto">You probably already have a Rust project on GitHub. You want to continue its development inside the container.<br>
For example, we will use my PWA+WebAssembly/WASM project <code>rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock</code>, which needs to forward port 8001 because our project needs a web server. That is fairly common. I am not a fan of autoForward <code>automagic</code> in VSCode, so I disable it in <code>File-Preferences-Settings</code> search <code>remote.autoForwardPorts</code> and uncheck it to false.<br>
We will continue to use the existing <code>VSCode terminal</code>, which is already opened in the folder <code>/home/rustdevuser/rustprojects/crustde_hello</code>. Just to practice.<br>
Run the commands to clone the repository from GitHub and open a new VSCode window. We already have the SSH private key and <code>ssh-agent</code> running:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd /home/rustdevuser/rustprojects/
git clone git@github.com:bestia-dev/rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock.git
code rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /home/rustdevuser/rustprojects/
git clone git@github.com:bestia-dev/rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock.git
code rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>code</code> command will open a new VSCode window in the folder <code>rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock</code>. Enter the SSH passphrase when asked. In the new VSCode window, we can now edit, compile and run the project. All are sandboxed/isolated inside the container. We can now close the other VSCode windows, we don't need it anymore.<br>
This example is somewhat more complex because it is WebAssembly, but it is good for learning. I used the automation tool <code>cargo-auto</code> to script a more complex building process. You can read the automation task code in <code>automation_task_rs/src/main.rs</code>. On the first, it will download the wasm components and wasm-bindgen. That can take some time. Don't whine!</p>
<p dir="auto">Now we can build and run the project in the <code>VSCode terminal</code> (Ctrl+j):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto" dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo auto build_and_run"><pre>cargo auto build_and_run</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In VSCode go to Ports and add port <code>4000</code>.<br>
Open the browser in Windows:<br>
<a href="http://localhost:4000/rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:4000/rust_wasm_pwa_minimal_clock/</a><br>
This is an example of Webassembly and PWA, directly from a Linux OCI container.<br>

No problem for Debian on bare metal. But the script is ok to restart the pod and start the sshd server.
So use it in both cases.<br>
