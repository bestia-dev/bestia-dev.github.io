    <h3><br/>Installation, first run and songs</h3>
    <p>1. Only the Leader needs to install this android app. The Followers will use their existing internet browser.</p>
    <p>2. This app is safe (no special permission is required on Android). But it is not on Google Play, so there are a few settings to allow the installation.
		<br/>The android installation package is called APK and can be downloaded and installed from unknown sources.
        <br/>Allow temporarily to install this APK: "Settings - Security - Install Unknown apps". Click on Chrome and "Allow from this source".
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/bestia-dev/GuitaraokeLeader/releases/download/v3.4/GuitaraokeLeader-release.apk">Download APK 3.4 for android</a></p>
    <p>3. After download, install it. Because this package is not from Google Play, there will be several warnings: 
        <br/>Do you really want to download? Do you really want to install it? Do you really trust this developer? 
        <br/>It is good that Android helps us for our security. You just answer to these warnings to continue anyway.
        <br/>The last question after installation is if you want to open the app. Answer "No", because first we need to prepare the local network.
    </p>
    <p>4. The installation is finished and you can revert back "Settings - Security - Install Unknown apps". Click on Chrome and turn off "Allow from this source".
    <p>5. This app needs a local network to function. If you are connected to internet over wi-fi, you are already on a local network.
        <br/>If you are connected to internet over "mobile data", you need to enable the mobile hotspot on your smartphone and share your internet connection. 
        <br/>This will create a local wi-fi network. Nobody will connect for now. We need it just to prepare the songs for the app and rehearse.
    </p>    
    <p>6. Open GuitaraokeLeader app for the first time. The app will immediately ask you to choose and allow access to a folder for the songs.
        <br/>This is for security reasons. The app cannot see any other folder or files. Just the one you manually choose. Every time.
        <br/>Because this is the first run, you have to first manually create a new Guitaraoke folder. 
        <br/>Go to the folder "Music" and create a new sub-folder "Guitaraoke".
        <br/>Inside your Guitaraoke folder create a sub-folders called "Practice".
        <br/>Finally click "Use this folder" and "Allow access" for the app. Very secure!
    </p>
    <p>7. Now the app shows the main page. Click on "Download song", choose a song to download. The song will be downloaded in the background. Slow.
        <br/>Later you can copy your mp4 songs with the android file manager to the "Music/Guitaraoke/Practice/" folder. That is much faster.
        <br/>You can use any mp4 file, there are many guitaraoke and karaoke videos on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>8. Click on the app title "GuitaraokeLeader" in the left upper corner to go back to the main page.</p>    
    <p>9. Click on the song and then "Play" and "Fullscreen". You can now practice your guitar and singing.</p>  
    <p>10. Click "back" to go out of FullScreen and then "Stop" to stop the song and go back to the main page.</p>  
    <p>11. You can now download more songs. </p>    
    <p>12. You already rehearse your guitar, now practice and rehearse with GuitaraokeLeader before going public !</p>
    <p>13. Create a new folder under the Guitaraoke folder for example "Rock" or "Romantic" or "Traditional". 
        <br/>Use the android file manager to copy the songs you know well from the folder "Practice".
        <br/>Create collections of songs for every event. You can choose the folder you want, everytime you start the app.
    </p>

    <h3><br/>Go live - instructions for the Leader</h3>
    <p>1. Limit the internet traffic, change the "Mobile networks - Network mode" to "2G only".
        <br/>Some smartphones when connected to wi-fi start immediately to download and sync enormous quantity of data. 
        <br/>But the 2G connection is so slow, that this will be barely visible on your data plan.
        </p>    
    <p>2. Enable the hotspot on your smartphone (share your internet connection, it will create a local wi-fi network).
        <br/>Change the network name to "GuitaraokeLeader" and the password to "guitaraoke3.4".
    </p>
    <p>3. Open GuitaraokeLeader app, choose your Guitaraoke folder like "Music/Guitaraoke/Rock" and allow access.</p>

        <br/>All modern smartphone can use this 2 QRCodes. Let the followers read them with their smartphones.
        <br/>When their application is running, they can share the same QRCodes to other people.
        <br/>Older phones have to do it old-school: connect to your wifi with a password and 
        <br/>write manually the address in the browser 192.168....:8080 (it is in the upper right corner).
    <p>5. The Leader can see the number of Followers. Ask if everybody is connected!</p>
    <p>6. The Leader clicks on a song, then clicks on the Play button and finally on the FullScreen button.</p>

    <p>9. You can Stop the song and return to the song list.</p>
    <p>10.After using GuitaraokeLeader: 
        <br/>Change the network name and password to what you had before Guitaraoke. Then stop you mobile hotspot.
        <br/>Revert the "Mobile networks - Network mode" to LTE.
